    <p class="Bilgewater-text">
      Nestled away in the Blue Flame Isles archipelago, Bilgewater is a port
      city like no other—home to serpent hunters, dock gangs, and smugglers from
      across the known world. Here, fortunes are made and ambitions shattered in
      the blink of an eye. For those fleeing justice, debt, or persecution,
      Bilgewater can be a place of new beginnings, for no one on these twisted
      streets cares about your past. Even so, with each new dawn, careless
      travelers can always be found floating in the harbor, their purses empty
      and their throats slit… While incredibly dangerous, Bilgewater is ripe
      with opportunity, free from the shackles of formal government and trade
      regulation. If you have the coin, almost anything can be purchased here,
      from outlawed hextech to the favor of local crime lords. With the recent
      removal of the last “reaver king” of Bilgewater, the city has entered a
      period of transition, while the most prominent captains try to agree on
      its future. But as long as there are seaworthy ships and crews to sail
      them, Bilgewater is likely to remain one of the most colorful and
      well-connected places in Runeterra.
